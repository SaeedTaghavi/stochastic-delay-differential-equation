# Introduction  
This is a summer project I did in 2018 summer in Imperial College London. The main task is to simulate the following logistic stochastic delay differential equation. 

$dW=X( \alpha +\beta X_\tau )dt+\sigma X dW$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are parameters of the deterministic delay logistic equation, and $X_\tau$
represent the state $\tau$
